    <h1>ALPENTOUR TROPHY</h1>
        <p>Top three in the elite men's, first and second rank in the women's. That's the Austrian answer to last year's Italian triple at the Alpentour
           Trophy. For four days it was again all about mountain biking in the Schladming-Dachstein region. Daniel Geismayr won overall in the men´s with
           Hermann Pernteiner and Alban Lakata in second and third; Christina Kollmann wins ahead of Angelika Tazreiter. </p>
        <p>The four stages brought the 400 participants from 30 countries onto the most infamous peaks in the region – all in all they had to complete almost
            200km and 9,400vm. The first day had them ride up to the Hochwurzen mountain and on to the pretty Giglach Lakes. Simon Stiebjahn, a German Cross-Country
            specialist won the stage, however, the Austrian favourites Hermann Pernsteiner, Daniel Geismayr and Alban Lakata were on his wheel. They took the
            second to fourth spots ahead of the Italian “King of the Mountain” Daniele Mensi.</p>
        <p>The second day was the Queen Stage of the event with a marathon through the Ramsau and to the Dachstein mountain base and on to Pichl.
            Next was a tough climb to the Reiteralm and to Rohrmoos. With a sensational ride Geismayr took the overall lead.
            He had felt good from the beginning and had been riding at the pace of the lead group, which had gotten smaller drastically towards the end,
            mainly due to the hot conditions. It had been a fight until the last descent with Alban Lakata, said Geismayr.</p>
        <p>The third stage featured the Hauser Kaibling and the Italian Daniele Mensi claimed the day's win. He did admit that he had wasted a
            lot of energy the day before at the Dachstein and had started the day calmly. He did so successfully and took the win ahead of the
            team riders Pernsteiner and Geismayr.</p>
